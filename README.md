Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the art of designing, building and maintaining software to solve real world problems.
Software engineering allows us to come up with products that let us interact with computers, and leverage them to ease our daily lives.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Introduction of High-level programming languages in the 1950s - allowed engineers to create programs faster in human readable languages, like FORTRAN, instead of the complex assembly and machine code languages.
Introduction of structured programming in the 1960s - provided a systematic flow to product development. Its emphasis on top-down design created order while modularity allowed creation of small program components at a time.
Object Oriented Programming in the 1980s - allowed modelling of complex real world objects to use in programming. This made it easier to create complex systems.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Analysis - you identify a problem and come up with a problem statement.
Design - you come up with a solution and how you will implement this solution
Implementation - you create the actual product and integrate it with the system whose problem you are solving

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is a software development methodology that emphasizes on sequential development. Each step is completed before moving on and there is no going back. It requires thorough planning and documentation upfront and seeks to deliver the final product once at the end. Waterfall methodology is suitable for regulation-heavy fields such as while creating healthcare products.
Agile methodology emphasizes flexibility. There is a lot of collaboration with team members and constant customer feedback, and it allows delivery of software in short cycles. It is suitable for dynamic markets, such as while creating social media apps, to keep up with changing customer needs. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer - Designs, develops and maintains software
Quality Assurance Engineer - Identifies and reports defects in products to ensure its reliability
Project Manager - Plans, executes and monitors software development to ensure they are completed on time and with efficient use of resources

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are software development products that provide an environment for writing, compiling and debugging code. They also streamline the coding process by automating repetitive tasks and highlighting different syntax. An example is Visual Studio Code.
Version Control Systems allow different engineers to collaborate on a single project. They track who made what changes and for what purpose. An example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Evolving market needs - Adopt the agile programming methodology
Changing technology - continuous learning
Collaboration and communication - regular meetings and proper documentation


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing - testing small portions of the program, such as individual functions. It allows the engineer to catch bugs early.
Integration testing - tests the interaction between different units of the program. Verifies that the different components make a cohesive subsytem.
System testing -  tests the completed program against specified requirements. Ensures the program meets all its functional and non-functional requirements.
Acceptance testing - this is done by end users to ensure the final product meets their specifications.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the art of crefting effective AI inputs, in order to elicit accurate outputs. Proper prompt engineering guides AI models to provide accurate and relevant outputs, minimizing risk of bias and inaccuracies.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt - Tell me about Malaria.
Improved prompt - Give me a summary of the pathophysiology of malaria, main vectors and epidemiology in Kenya. 
The improved point is clear in wanting only a summary, it is specific to the pathophysiology, vectors and epidemiology of malaria, and is concise as it dives directly to the point.
